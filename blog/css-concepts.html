<h3>Sept. 28: Is That Padding Soft Enough?</h3>
<h4>
<br>
Boy was I wrong in voicing any kind of cautous optimism about my ability to romp through HTML and CSS. I've been throughly humbled this past week, finding myself unable to come up with a CSS template that didn't look like its was designed by a drunken monkey. (It now looks like it was written by a sober monkey. Progress!) <br>
Anyone wants to look at the gruesome outcome, here is the main site: http://mfhan.github.io/
<br>
So now I will attempt to explain a key concept in CSS:

<br>
What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding? </h4>
<h5>
Glad you asked!
<br>
Within the "box model" that governs CSS, margin, border and padding play an essential role in enhancing the content, making it more visible, legible and in tune with the character and design of the overall site. Inspired by age-old typography seen in books and newsprint, the three elements are often only noticeable when they are absent or flawed.
<br>The PADDING is a transparent element that clears a perimeter around the content; a text with no margin would be pretty oppressive and hard to read, because the letters would bump into the BORDER, which marks a visible boundary between one type of content and another. The border itself is surrounded by a MARGIN, which like the padding is a transparent space that establishes an area outside the border and gives the whole page breathing space. <br>
An example of a simple but popular site where the box concept is evident would be slate.com:

<br>
While the Donald Trump article uses no padding, the image has a thin border and a margin that prevents the item from bumping into the other news items. And for elements that are text-only, the margin ensures that each story teaser is legible and well separated from other elements. <br>
Another important consideration is that while consistent margins and borders are often crucial to maintain the look and unity of Slate, the padding is more variable, which helps avoid a cookie-cutter look and gives the impression of a more spontaneous, more topical news outlet.
