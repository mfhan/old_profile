Version Control to Major Tom: <br>
A Stellar Coding Adventure
</div>

<br>
Sept. 14
<br>
After a week-long forced march through the rigors of Git and GitHub, I seem to have a few clues as to what they were created for.
<br>
What are the benefits of version control?
<br>
Version control allows a programmer to keep track of a project under various stages and with various changes. Within the context of a team, it enables programmers to compare versions, choose the elements that are best and credit the proper contributor. In a discipline that's based on trial and (mostly) error, version control helps maintain programmers' sanity.
<br>
How does git help you keep track of changes?
<br>
git allows me to commit versions of the same work, keeping track of infinite options that I can revert to and merge if needed. It lives in the command line, making everything simple and easier to tame.
<br>
Why use GitHub to store your code?
<br>
Storing in GitHub in public mode allows everyone to contribute to a given project. It also allows the original creator to keep track of the contributions, give credit to collaborators, pick the best solution without losing other versions.
