<p>After a week-long forced march through the rigors of Git and GitHub, I seem to have a few clues as to what they were created for. </p>

<p>The big chunk of meat our cohort has had to chew on (and digest) this week is the concept of "Enumerable."" The Enumerable module provides a collection of methods we can apply to iterate on Ruby's collection classes, in order to search, sort and manipulate them.  It's a bit hard to penetrate at first, but it saves a tremendous amount of time if you learn to use them well.
 <br><br>
There are myriads methods inside the Enumerable class, the most popuar ones being: Each, each_with_index, map or collect, chunk, partition, select, and inject.<br>
What makes it even more flexible, one can combine methods, such as map and each: if you chain the each_with_index method with map, you can have access to the current index inside your map block. <br><br>

<p>How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?</p>
<p>It was very nerve-wracking and humbling, as I realized how primitive and clunky my wireframe was to soeone who was seeking it for the first time. It was relatively difficult to discuss the specifics of a wireframe in the time frame allotted. </p>
<p>Creating the HTML page went smoothly since we weren't obsessing about formatting, colors etc
</p>

<p>Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?</p>
<p>I really wasn't quite sure what wireframing truly was and how it could really help plan a page; I now have a better understanding of its importance as a visualization tool</p>
<p>What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?</p>
<p>Simplicity, portability, navigation (needs link to home page), date</p>

<p>What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?</p>
