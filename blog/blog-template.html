<p>After a week-long forced march through the rigors of Git and GitHub, I seem to have a few clues as to what they were created for. </p>


<p><strong>What are the benefits of version control?</strong></p>

<p>Version control allows a programmer to keep track of a project under various stages and with various changes. Within the context of a team, it enables programmers to compare versions, choose the elements that are best and credit the proper contributor. In a discipline that's based on trial and (mostly) error, version control helps maintain programmers' sanity.</p>

  <p><strong>How does git help you keep track of changes?</strong></p>

<p>git allows me to commit versions of the same work, keeping track of infinite options that I can revert to and merge if needed. It lives in the command line, making everything simple and easier to tame.</p>

<p><strong>Why use GitHub to store your code?</strong></p>

<p>Storing in GitHub in public mode allows everyone to contribute to a given project. It also allows the original creator to keep track of the contributions, give credit to collaborators, pick the best solution without losing other versions.</p>

<p>How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?</p>
<p>It was very nerve-wracking and humbling, as I realized how primitive and clunky my wireframe was to soeone who was seeking it for the first time. It was relatively difficult to discuss the specifics of a wireframe in the time frame allotted. </p>
<p>Creating the HTML page went smoothly since we weren't obsessing about formatting, colors etc
</p>

<p>Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?</p>
<p>I really wasn't quite sure what wireframing truly was and how it could really help plan a page; I now have a better understanding of its importance as a visualization tool</p>
<p>What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?</p>
<p>Simplicity, portability, navigation (needs link to home page), date</p>

<p>What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?</p>
