<h2>Oct. 26: JavaScript, Not Just a Pretty Object </h2>
<br> <h3> Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects </h3>
<p>
 <br><br><h4>
This week's new focus, JavaScript, was less of a mountain to climb simply because the language has so many similarities with Ruby. While the two languages remain distinct, they still use a number of tools which, despite different naming conventions, accomplish more or less the same role.
JavaScript's Objects has functionality that can be easily compared to Ruby's Hash.<br>
A hash, as we know, is a collection of key-value pairs linking a key such as "name" to the value "Charlotte" or "Age" to the number 25.<br>
Objects are JavaScript's way of organizing key-value pairs.
The expression of those relationships is, of course, different.
<br>
For instance, JavaScript would express that relationship thus: </h4>
<ruby>
var woman = {name: "Charlotte", age: "35"} </ruby>
<h4>
Ruby will instead say:</h4>
<ruby>woman = {"name" => "Charlotte", "age" => 35}</ruby>
<h4>
To access the data, the idea is the same but the methods vary: in JavaScript, you would learn Charlotte's age by calling woman.age; whereas in Ruby, you would write woman[age].
<br>
Modifying the content of an object or a hash is equally simple. If I were to add the key "Hometown", I would do this:</h4>
<ruby>woman.hometown = "New York"; </ruby><h4>in JavaScript,
 and simply write:</h4>
<ruby>
 woman['hometown'] = "New York"</ruby> <h4>in Ruby.
 <br>
Same ideas, slight differences in syntax and punctuation.
</h4>
