<h3>Oct. 5, Take Two: Diversity in Tech</h3>
<h4>
<br>
Before embarking on this arduous journey that has me spending all my waking hours reading textbooks and banging out incorrect Ruby code, before I made the decision to learn something new and experience failure, I did research the very industry I was about to join, and what I found was, let's say, sub-optimal. <br><br>
It is at this point well established that the tech industry, for all its capacity to disrupt and innovate, has been neither disruptive nor innovative when it comes to being more willing to hire and nurture people that don't conform to a strictlycodified set of criteria: youth, educational background, ethnic origin and gender. <br><br>
The facts have been repeated so many times that they are in danger of becoming a familiar litany -- but the numbers remain shocking.
<br>
<h3>Widening Gender Gap </h3>
<h5>
<br> Women hold only 9 percent of management positions in IT and account for only 14 percent of senior management positions at Silicon Valley startups, according to a 2014 study by the Center for American Progress (CFAP). They only represent 26 percent of IT workers, a federal survey shows. In cyber security, an area that is poised for dramatic growth in coming years, women account for just one out of 10  professionals with the gender gap widening over the past two years, according to an industry survey quoted by <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/28/us-cybersecurity-women-employment-idUSKCN0RS11J20150928">Reuters</a>.
<br>
<br> Lack of diversity is even more acute with ethnic minorities. African Americans, who account for 13.6% of the US population, according to the 2010 US census, represent less than 1.5% of Facebook’s almost 5,500 US employees. In 2013, Facebook hired just one black woman, The Guardian <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/30/silicon-valley-black-employees-diversity-google-apple">reported</a> in July. Twitter employs just 49 black people, less than 2 percent of its U.S.staff, while African Americans represent just 2 percent Yahoo and Google's U.S workforce.  <br><br>
Inclusion is also hard to find for those who dare to surrender to the aging process and have the audacity to turn 30, 35 or even 40 -- ages at which, the industry seems to think, one must simply quietly disappear in shame. <br>
As shown in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html">The New York Times’s</a> account of Amazon.com's brutal work culture, where middle-aged employees with families or physical ailments are required to work punishing hours and are ostracized for being sick, or in the discrimination lawsuits filed against Google and Twitter, or in the many instances of "older" workers rejected from jobs with the all-purpose <a href="https://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2015/03/18/pages/5698/index.xml">explanation</a> that they didn't “fit” the existing corporate culture. <br>
<h3>Panel Overload<h3>
 <h5><br>Yet I can't help but feel annoyed whenever I see an Internet invitation to attend another panel on Tech Diversity. Panels can only do so much, what's needed is a strong commitment from industry leaders to change the poisonous culture of discrimination that's making the tech industry the object of scorn, suspicion and, yes disdain.
 <br><br>
Are there bright spots? Yes, thankfully.
 <br>Twitter and other tech companies have publicly committed to changing the ratio of minorities and women in positions at the company, by partnering with organizations such as Girls Who Code and Out in Tech. Intel, which earlier this year said it wanted its workforce to mirror the overall American workforce by 2020, has followed up by releasing a mid-year progress report. More than the actual achievements made over a six-month span, it is the company's clearly-stated hiring targets and efforts at transparency that may change the way Big Tech is going about diversity.  <br><br>  <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/07/30/pinterest-diversity-women-underrepresented-minorities-silicon-valley-jesse-jackson/30881091/">Pinterest</a> has pioneered the collection of data on women in tech since Tracy Chou, one of its engineers, challenged tech companies to disclose how many female engineers they were employing.
 <br><h3>Bootcamp Love!<h3>
 <h5>
In a more modest but palpable way, coding bootcamps may provide another solution to the underrepresentatioon of women and minorities in tech. According to a study conducted by <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2015/09/17/as-coding-bootcamps-grow-the-skills-gap-could-shrink">LinkedIn</a>, an analysis of profiles shows that no fewer 38% of bootcamp alumni are women. Two of the 10 programs listed in the LinkedIn survey are majority women: Toronto's HackerYou (65.1%) and Atlanta's Tech Talent South (53.5%).
 <br><br>
Similarly, <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/resources/course-report-bootcamp-graduate-demographics-outcomes-study">Course Report's</a> survey of 42 coding boot camps shows that 38 percent of the more than 6,000 graduates in 2014 were women, an enormous contrast to the 18 percent of computer science degrees awarded to women in 2013, according to Department of Labor statistics data.
<br><br>Enormous efforts must be made, and even then the numbers will probably remain largely lopsided. But the very fact that I, a woman with a full former career in journalism, is embarking on an arduous bootcamp, may indicate how much progress technology has made to make itself both attractive and attainable to people like me.
