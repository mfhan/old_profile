<h2>Oct. 11: Enumerable on a Bicycle</h2>
<h4>
<br>
The big chunk of WebDev wisdom our cohort has had to chew on (and digest) this week is the concept of "Enumerable." The Enumerable module provides a collection of methods we can apply to iterate on Ruby's collection classes, in order to search, sort and manipulate them.  It's a bit hard to penetrate at first, but it saves a tremendous amount of time if you learn to use these enumerables well.
 <br><br>
There are myriads methods inside the Enumerable class, the most popuar ones being: Each, each_with_index, map or collect, chunk, partition, select, and inject.
What makes it even more flexible, one can combine methods, such as map and each: if you chain the each_with_index method with map, you can have access to the current index inside your map block. <br><br>

<h4>Enumerable#cycle</h4>
<h5>
<br>Enumerable#cycle yields all the elements in the objet again and again in a loop. The argument to #cycle specifies the number of times to cycle. If no integer is provided, it will be run to INFINITY.
<br>
<br>
<br> Let's say we write this list of clothing sizes:
<br>arr.cycle(2) { |i| puts i }
<br>The cycle will be performed twice:
<br>Small
<br>Medium
<br>Large
<br>Extra Large
<br>Small
<br>Medium
<br>Large
<br>Extra Large
<br>

<br>
Another example: you have a given number of skirts and want to wear a different one each day? We can make that happen.
<br>
<br>
skirt_type = %w{Pencil Business A_Line Wool_Blend Plaid Pleated Denim}
=> ["Pencil", "Business", "A_Line", "Wool_Blend", "Plaid", "Pleated", "Denim"]
<br>
<br>skirt_type.cycle {|skirt| puts skirt}
<br>=> Pencil
<br>Business
<br>A_Line
<br>Wool_Blend
<br>Plaid
<br>Pleated
<br>Denim
<br>Pencil
<br>Business
<br>...
<br>
<br> The cycle can be broken with the "break" statement
<br>skirt_type.cycle do |skirt|
<br>    puts skirt
<br>    break if skirt == "Plaid"
<br>end
<br>=> Pencil
<br>Business
<br>A_Line
<br>Wool_Blend
<br>Pleated
<br>=> nil
<br>
<br>
<br> Conclusion: the #cycle method can be used to decide dynamically how many times to iterate through a collection. So now I can go and buy more skirts.
