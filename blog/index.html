<a href="http://mfhan.github.io/blog/css-concepts.html"> Is That Padding Soft Enough? </a>
<h4>
<p>
Boy was I wrong in voicing any kind of cautous optimism about my ability to romp through HTML and CSS. I've been throughly humbled this past week, finding myself unable to come up with a CSS template that didn't look like its was designed by a drunken monkey. (It now looks like it was written by a sober monkey. Progress!)
<p>Anyone wants to look at the gruesome outcome, here is the main site: http://mfhan.github.io/ </p>
<p>So now I will attempt to explain a key concept in CSS:
<p>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
Glad you asked! </p>
<p>Within the "box model" that governs CSS, margin, border and padding play an essential role in enhancing the content, making it more visible, legible and in tune with the character and design of the overall site. Inspired by age-old typography seen in books and newsprint, the three elements are often only noticeable when they are absent or flawed.
