**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**
I learned how interconnected and delicate these elements were. I realized that trying and failing an excessive amount of times is the only to get a handle on these elements.


**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**
To be honest, my attempts at using absolute and relative positioning for some key elements of my page and blog were total failires, so I resorted to a container format.


**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**
Nothing came easily to this novice, not even the title blocks. Tutorials on Codecademy and other outlets, while instrcutive, do not give a glimpse of the complexity of CSS writing. I learned a lot by trying everything, spending a lot of time and sweat on wild-goose chases, and finally coming up with a reasonable alternative.


**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
I learned that sizing and spacing have to be consistent and well thought-out for the webpage to look clean and readable. I learned the value of categorizing everything.
