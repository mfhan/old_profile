    <p> What are the benefits of version control?</p>
    <p>Version control allows a programmer to keep track of a project under various stages and with various changes. Within the context of a team, it enables programmers to compare versions, choose the elements that are best and credit the proper contributor. 
In a discipline that's based on trial and (mostly) error, version control helps maintain programmers' sanity.

        How does git help you keep track of changes?</p>
    <p>
        git allows me to commit versions of the same work, keeping track of infinite options that I can revert to and merge if needed. It lives in the command line, making everything simple and easier to tame.

 <p>Why use GitHub to store your code?
    </p>
    <p>Storing in GitHub in public mode allows everyone to contribute to a given project.  It also allows the original creator to keep track of the contributions, give credit etc.
