<h4>About Me</h4>
<br>
<br>I was born in Paris to Korean parents and grew up in Africa: Cote d'Ivoire, Tunisia, Morocco and Cameroon. I came to the U.S. to get a degree in journalism, and have been based in New York for the past few years. I covered Asian technology companies for Reuters and most recently edited stories on China and Russia.
