      What are the benefits of version control?

    <p>
        Version control allows a programmer to keep track of a project under various stages and with various changes. Within the context of a team, it enables programmers to compare versions, choose the elements that are best and credit the proper contributor. 
In a discipline that's based on trial and (mostly) error, version control helps maintain programmers' sanity.

-- git allows me to commit versions of the same work, keeping track of infinite options that I can revert to and merge if needed. It lives in the command line, making everything simple and easier to tame.
