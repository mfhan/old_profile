<p>After a week-long forced march through the rigors of Git and GitHub, I seem to have a few clues as to what they were created for. </p>

<p><strong>What are the benefits of version control?</strong></p>

<p>Version control allows a programmer to keep track of a project under various stages and with various changes. Within the context of a team, it enables programmers to compare versions, choose the elements that are best and credit the proper contributor. In a discipline that's based on trial and (mostly) error, version control helps maintain programmers' sanity.</p>

<p><strong>How does git help you keep track of changes?</strong></p>

<p>git allows me to commit versions of the same work, keeping track of infinite options that I can revert to and merge if needed. It lives in the command line, making everything simple and easier to tame.</p>

<p><strong>Why use GitHub to store your code?</strong></p>

<p>Storing in GitHub in public mode allows everyone to contribute to a given project. It also allows the original creator to keep track of the contributions, give credit to collaborators, pick the best solution without losing other versions.</p>

<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
<br>It was nerve-wracking to show my paltry attempts at wireframing to a new set of eyes. I immediately realized that it lacked some key elements such as a link to the home page.
Creating the HTML template was a smoother task as my navigator was on top of the code and we kept the template as simple as possible.

<br>Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
<br>Yes; I had previously not really understood the value of wireframing when conceiving a page from scratch. I now realize how important it is to try to visualize a site before building it.

<br>What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
<br>Simplicity, clarity, good navigation

<br>What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
<br>Added some section breaks.
