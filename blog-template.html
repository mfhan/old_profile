<h2>Version Control to Major Tom </h2>

<h4>Straight to the Web Dev Stratosphere </h4>

<h6>Sept. 14</h6>

<p>After a week-long forced march through the rigors of Git and GitHub, I seem to have a few clues as to what they were created for. </p>

<p><strong>What are the benefits of version control?</strong></p>

<p>Version control allows a programmer to keep track of a project under various stages and with various changes. Within the context of a team, it enables programmers to compare versions, choose the elements that are best and credit the proper contributor. In a discipline that's based on trial and (mostly) error, version control helps maintain programmers' sanity.</p>

<p><strong>How does git help you keep track of changes?</strong></p>

<p>git allows me to commit versions of the same work, keeping track of infinite options that I can revert to and merge if needed. It lives in the command line, making everything simple and easier to tame.</p>

<p><strong>Why use GitHub to store your code?</strong></p>

<p>Storing in GitHub in public mode allows everyone to contribute to a given project. It also allows the original creator to keep track of the contributions, give credit to collaborators, pick the best solution without losing other versions.</p>
