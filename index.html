  Ruby is by nature a pretty friendly and accommodating language -- or so say those who have either mastered its complexity, or those who have never touched it. As for me, about to complete Week Six of Phase 0, I remain ofen befuddled by its syntax and its "magic" dust -- event though I am slowly starting to understand its mechanisms and its intricacies. Learning is HARD, and learning Ruby has been a major challenge in my life.
 <br><br>
The week's highlight has been the concept of Class, and its attendant elements.
<br>
Classes are at the core of Ruby programming because they define objects and what they can do. The class concept allows us to write our own categories of objects in neat bundles that will include methods. <br><br>
