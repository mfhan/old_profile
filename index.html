  <p><h4>
This week's new focus, JavaScript, was less of a mountain to climb simply because the language has so many similarities with Ruby. While the two languages remain distinct, they still use a number of tools which, despite different naming conventions, accomplish more or less the same role.
JavaScript's Objects has functionality that can be easily compared to Ruby's Hash.<br>
A hash, as we know, is a collection of key-value pairs linking a key such as "name" to the value "Charlotte" or "Age" to the number 25.<br>
Objects are JavaScript's way of organizing key-value pairs.
The expression of those relationships is, of course, different. <br><br>
