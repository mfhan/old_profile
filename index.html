  <p><h4> One of the very very ultra essential important things that one must know about Ruby is a tool that hides under a rather benign name: Regular Expressions, or Regex.
 <br>While they do come preceded with a rather sinister reputation, regexes are "simply" tools that provide away of finding, replacing or specifying a pattern of characters in a strong. The slash / character signals a regex. <br>
In Ruby, regexes are instances of the Regexp class and provides ready methods to manipulate data. One such method is gsub, which stands for global substitution, meaning it finds and replaces all instances of a given pattern. <br>
Among other colorful characters, there is the dot, the Leatherman multitool of the regex world, which matches anything -- symbols, letter, number.
